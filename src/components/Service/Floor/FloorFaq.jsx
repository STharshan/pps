            question: "How often should I get strip and wax service?",
            answer:
                "We recommend a full strip and wax service every 6â€“12 months, depending on your traffic level and floor type. High-traffic commercial spaces may benefit from more frequent service, while residential or low-traffic areas can go longer between treatments.",
        },
        {
            id: 2,
            question: "How long does the process take?",
            answer:
                "The timeline depends on the size of the area and floor condition. Most commercial spaces can be completed in 1-2 days. We use quick-dry waxes that minimize downtime, and we can work during off-hours to avoid disrupting your business operations.",
        },
        {
            id: 3,
            question: "Will the wax smell or cause disruption?",
            answer:
                "We use low-odor, eco-safe waxes specifically designed for occupied spaces. Our quick-dry formulas mean minimal disruption to your home or business. Most areas can be walked on within a few hours of completion.",
        },
        {
            id: 4,
            question: "What types of floors can you service?",
            answer:
                "We specialize in VCT (Vinyl Composite Tile), linoleum, hardwood, marble, and concrete floors. Each surface type requires specific techniques and products, which our trained specialists are expert in applying.",
        },
        {
            id: 5,
            question: "How do I maintain my floors between services?",
            answer:
                "Regular dust mopping and damp mopping with pH-neutral cleaners will help maintain your floor's shine. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaning tools. We can provide specific maintenance recommendations based on your floor type and traffic level.",
        },
        {
            id: 6,
            question: "Is strip and wax better than just buffing?",
            answer:
                "Yes, for long-term results. While buffing can temporarily restore shine, strip and wax removes all old buildup and applies fresh protective layers. This provides better protection, longer-lasting shine, and prevents permanent damage to your flooring.",
        },
