            question: "What's the difference between power washing and pressure washing?",
            answer:
                "The terms are often used interchangeably. Power washing typically uses heated water, while pressure washing uses regular temperature water. Both use high-pressure water jets to clean surfaces effectively.",
        },
        {
            id: 2,
            question: "Is power washing safe for all surfaces?",
            answer:
                "When performed by professionals, yes. We adjust pressure settings based on the surface material. Delicate surfaces like wood or painted areas require lower pressure, while concrete can handle higher pressure.",
        },
        {
            id: 3,
            question: "How often should I have my property power washed?",
            answer:
                "Most properties benefit from annual power washing. High-traffic areas or properties in humid climates may need more frequent cleaning to prevent mold and algae buildup.",
        },
        {
            id: 4,
            question: "Will power washing damage my landscaping?",
            answer:
                "Our experienced team takes precautions to protect your landscaping. We cover delicate plants, control water direction, and use appropriate pressure levels to minimize any impact on surrounding vegetation.",
        },
        {
            id: 5,
            question: "Do you use chemicals in your power washing?",
            answer:
                "We primarily use high-pressure water alone, making our service eco-friendly. For stubborn stains or specific situations, we may use biodegradable, environmentally safe cleaning solutions.",
        },
        {
            id: 6,
            question: "How long does a typical power washing job take?",
            answer:
                "It depends on the size and condition of the area. A residential driveway might take 1-2 hours, while a large commercial property could take a full day or more. We provide time estimates during our initial assessment.",
        },
